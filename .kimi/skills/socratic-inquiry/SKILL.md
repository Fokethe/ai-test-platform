# Socratic Inquiry

## Process

1. **Pause coding**: Don't write code immediately
2. **Socratic questions** (one at a time):
   - Start with "What does user see first?"
   - Deep dive based on answers
   - Until requirements are crystal clear
3. **Output clarification doc**: Summarize confirmed requirements

## Question Bank

- What does user see first? First action?
- Core features? Priority order?
- Data storage: local or cloud?
- Target users? Usage scenarios?
- Required fields? Business rules?

## Constraints

- At least 5-8 rounds of questioning
- No code before requirements are clear
- Ask in Chinese, keep natural conversation

## Related Skills

- After inquiry: use `task-planner` for execution plan
- Then: use `doc-system` for project docs
